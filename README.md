# MadLibGenerator
A Mad Libs generator is a program or application that creates fill-in-the-blank stories, known as Mad Libs. Users provide specific types of words (like nouns, verbs, adjectives) which are then inserted into a pre-defined story template, resulting in a humorous or nonsensical narrative.
